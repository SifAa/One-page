One page application to-do list and quiz-program

You need to finalize the two projects quiz-program and to-do-list from section 8 and 10 at Udemy. 

Then you have to merge the two projects into one project (a single page application). 

A single page application is an application that doesn't reload the page. This means that you cannot use links to go from page to another. 
Instead you could hide and show blocks of HTML with JavaScript. 

You are very welcome to put your own look and fell on your project.
